                <p class="story-paragraph">
                  My website offers users the opportunity to watch and learn card tricks.
                  It gives people the ability, and it is optional, to learn the trick via
                  a tutorial. This funcitonlity was added as many people like to keep the
                  WOW factor of watching a card trick and not knowing how it was done. There
                  is also the ability to contact me through the contact form with any feedback
                  or questions.

                  The Inspiration Of My Website
                </h1>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                  There are two inspirations which made me 
                  want to create this website. The first, my brother. I do not 
                  see much of my brother and we have very little in common, however, 
                  card tricks is one thing we can bond over. With the lack of seeing 
                  him and the added problem of COVID-19, my brother and me were unable 
                  to really talk or bond over anything. So I had the idea of creating 
                  a website where he can still learn tricks from me but also so can 
                  everyone else who wishes to. The second, my grandpa. He
                  suffers from vascular dementia and before he was diagnosed he loved 
                  card tricks. He would always perform them for his grandchildren, his 
                  children and my nan but he does not have that luxury anymore. At first 
                  I carried the tricks on in person with him but now he is at a point 
                  where he cannot comprehend what is going on or who I am and I saw this 
                  frustrated him. So this is a way for him to not stress about who is 
                  performing the trick but just to be entertained by it.
